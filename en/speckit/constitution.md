# Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### Principle I. Product-Oriented ML Microservice Architecture
- Each service is implemented as a set of independent, containerized components: public HTTP API, asynchronous computation workers, data preparation pipelines, ML infrastructure, and others.
- All APIs comply with REST, support idempotency, return proper HTTP status codes, and provide extensible contract schemas.

### Principle II. Containerization and Open Infrastructure
- All services, clients, test runners, and auxiliary tools are deployed via `docker-compose.yml`; no mandatory dependencies are required on the host machine.
- By default, no interpreters (Python, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, etc.) are expected to be installed on the host; if scripts need to run, the interpreters are executed inside corresponding containers without host installation.
- Only open-source solutions are used for computation, data storage, queues, feature store, and ML life-cycle (e.g., FastAPI/Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, Feast, MLflow, Prefect).
- Tests and client SDKs (JS, PHP, shell) are placed in separate containers and can be executed independently.

### Principle III. Observability and Diagnosability
- All requests, errors, and background jobs must be logged in a structured format with mandatory trace IDs, channel metadata, device data, and `customer_id`.
- Each key service must expose health-check endpoints and metrics (latency, throughput, queue depth, recommendation quality) for monitoring.
- Diagnostic commands, `docker-compose logs`, and investigation scripts must be provided for incident analysis; logging should expand along with new functionality.

### Principle IV. Managed Configuration and Documentation
- All configurations are read from `.env`; each variable’s meaning must be documented in README or reference guides. Any new variable must include an example in `env.example` and setup instructions.
- Documentation and specifications are maintained in English, including `curl` examples, script samples, ML algorithm descriptions for business use, and run guides.
- Any change in API, configuration, or process requires updating the README, quickstart guides, contracts, and migration comments.

### Principle V. Quality, Testing, and Experimentation
- Unit, integration, and load tests are mandatory for all components; synthetic data should be generated automatically when needed.
- For different test classes, appropriate environments are used:
  - Built-in framework unit tests run inside their respective service containers.
  - HTTP API and browser (e2e, Playwright) tests run in a dedicated test container.
  - All test containers are connected via the shared `docker-compose.yml`.
- The set of containers can be extended at the team’s discretion.

## Technological Standards
- Backend APIs must follow REST principles.
- Client implementations (JS, PHP, shell) and utility scripts are built in separate containers; scripts should support tracing and `.env` configuration when possible.
- Every endpoint must provide usage examples.

## Workflow and Compliance
- Before starting development, each feature must undergo a Constitution Check stage; any nonconformities are recorded in the Complexity Tracking table with justification.
- Tests must run in containers defined in `docker-compose.yml`; the CI/CD pipeline must use the same images.
- When APIs, data, or configurations change, documentation, contract schemas, and `env.example` must be updated accordingly.
- Logs and metrics are analyzed via provided scripts; investigation results are recorded in documentation or post-mortem reports.
- Any service using nonstandard ports must be documented along with proxying rules through frontend containers.

## Governance
- The Constitution has the highest authority: architectural decisions, project plans, and code reviews are all verified for compliance with its principles.
- Every significant service change must include verification of plans, specifications, and task lists for adherence to the principles and technological standards.
