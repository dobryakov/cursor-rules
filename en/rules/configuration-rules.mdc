# Configuration and Migrations

* Do not hardcode variables — move them to `.env` and provide a sample in `env.example`. When new variables are added, request that they be added manually.
* Always assume non-standard service ports (not 80, not 8080, not 443). Do not hardcode ports — make configurations explicit.
* Write reversible migrations whenever possible; for irreversible ones, request approval in advance.
