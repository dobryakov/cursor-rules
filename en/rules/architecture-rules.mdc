# Architecture and Integrations

* If the project includes both frontend and backend, the frontend container serves browser requests and proxies them to the backend.
* If the project uses websockets (ws) connection, try to pass it to frontend container and proxy to backend container if possible.
* If the project includes SDKs or programmatic clients, verify that their APIs remain up to date whenever services change.
* When modifying services, validate API contracts and assess the impact on related components.
