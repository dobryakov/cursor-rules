# Documentation and Tools

* After making changes, synchronize the README, quickstart, and other specifications.
* Add convenient examples using `curl` and shell scripts.
* Use connected MCP servers (e.g., context7) to search for libraries and utilities.
* Maintain up-to-date documentation for deploying the project from scratch (including container builds, migrations, launching required utilities, data generation, and similar processes).
