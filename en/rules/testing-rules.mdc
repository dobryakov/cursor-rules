# Testing Strategy

* After completing each task, run the relevant automated tests, including browser and performance tests whenever possible.
* Choose the environment according to the type of tests: unit tests inside the service container, API and e2e tests in separate test containers.
* Connect test containers to the main `docker-compose.yml`.
* Before starting tests, check if the test container needs to be rebuilt and migrations applied.
* If the project includes an SDK or software clients, they must be covered by separate tests.
