# Testing Strategy

* Do not run tests on the host! Run tests inside docker containers.
* After completing each task, run the relevant automated tests, including browser and performance tests whenever possible.
* Choose the environment according to the type of tests: unit tests inside the service container, API and e2e tests in separate test containers.
* Connect test containers to the main `docker-compose.yml`.
* Before starting tests, check if the test container needs to be rebuilt and migrations applied.
* If the project includes an SDK or software clients, they must be covered by separate tests.
* If using Playwright, make sure you have browsers installed to the test container.
* If using Playwright, consider to use proper "FROM" image (for example, debian-based node.js image) in the Dockerfile before building test container.
* When calling `docker compose logs` with `tail`, use proper syntax: `docker compose logs --tail 10 <container name>`.
