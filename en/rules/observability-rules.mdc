# Observability and Diagnostics

* Use all available logs (scripts, automated tests, proxies, browser console, docker-compose) to identify the causes of errors.
* Add diagnostic output and trace IDs to track the request flow through logs.
* Implement health checks for key functions that are suitable for monitoring.
* If the project contains health checks based on curl, make sure curl is included into docker image.
* Always log incoming and outgoing HTTP requests and messages (including full body content or at least major attributes).
* For python use `structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer()` for structured logging to ensure consistent colored console output across all services for better readability during development and debugging.
